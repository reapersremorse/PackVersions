# PackVersions
 This is a historical versioning git for my packs

 these packs are made in a way that anyone can install them on the twitch app.

 in order to install thses packs you must open the app, navigate to the area where you manage packs. 

 then click on create pack
 and at the top of the popup you should see import. 
 click that then navigate to where you saved this file. 
 select the file then open it. 
 this should start the process of importing this pack.
 if you have a slower computer it may take a few seconds in order to start.
